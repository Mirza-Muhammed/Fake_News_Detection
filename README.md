# 🚀 Fake News Detection  
An AI-powered system for detecting and classifying news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE** using NLP and Machine Learning.  

---

# 📌 Overview  
Fake News Detection is designed to help identify misleading or false information in news content.  
It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Machine Learning models** to classify text-based news as *Real* or *Fake*.  

The project includes a **training pipeline**, a **Flask web app** for live predictions, and easy integration with datasets from Kaggle or custom sources.  

---

# 🌟 Key Features  
- **Custom Dataset Support** → Works with any CSV-based dataset.  
- **Automated Preprocessing** → Cleans and prepares text for training.  
- **ML Pipeline** → TF-IDF + Machine Learning classifier.  
- **Web Interface** → Paste news text and get instant predictions.  
- **Model Persistence** → Saves trained model & vectorizer for reuse.  
- **Extendable** → Easily plug in new ML models or Deep Learning.  

---

# 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **ML/NLP:** Scikit-learn, TF-IDF  
- **Database (Optional):** SQLite for logging results  

---

# 🔨 Workflow  

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Place dataset in `data/news.csv` with columns:  
     - `text` → article or headline text  
     - `label` → FAKE / REAL / 0 / 1  

   - If you have separate `Fake.csv` and `True.csv`, just run `train.py` — it will auto-detect & combine them.  

2. **Model Training**  
   ```sh
   python train.py

3. **Run the Web App**
   ```sh
    python app.py

Access the app at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

4.  **(Optional) Deployment**

Deploy with Heroku, Docker, or any cloud service.
